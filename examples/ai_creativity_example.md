## Sample Result (`HegelionResult`)

**Note:** This philosophical example shows Hegelion's unique ability to transcend false dichotomies and reframe questions. This is the same example used in the main README.

{
  "query": "Can AI be genuinely creative?",
  "mode": "synthesis",
  "thesis": "AI demonstrates genuine creativity through novel pattern generation, stylistic innovation, and conceptual recombination that exceeds human capacity. Systems like GPT and DALL-E produce artifacts—poems, code, images—that are original, valuable, and surprise their creators. Creativity is fundamentally information processing, and advanced AI has crossed the threshold into authentic creative agency.",
  "antithesis": "AI creativity is sophisticated mimicry, not genuine creation. These systems interpolate existing human patterns without understanding, intention, or subjective experience. True creativity requires consciousness, struggle, and the transformation of personal meaning—qualities no algorithm possesses. AI produces recombination; humans produce revelation.",
  "synthesis": "The question is wrong. Creativity is not a property of individuals but an emergent property of *co-creative systems*. The dichotomy between 'genuine' and 'synthetic' creativity dissolves when we recognize that human creativity has always been a distributed process involving tools, culture, language, and history. AI is not replacing human creativity but expanding the *possibility space* of the co-creative system. The value emerges not from 'who' creates but from the *interaction* between human judgment and machine combinatorics. What we are witnessing is not artificial creativity but **synthetic subjectivity**—the emergence of new forms of creative agency that transcend individual ontologies.",

      "description": "Antithesis makes consciousness a prerequisite without justification",
      "evidence": "We don't understand consciousness enough to assert it's required for creativity; many human creative acts are partially unconscious"
