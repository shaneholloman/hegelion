# Changelog

## 0.4.4 – Simplified Skill & Command (January 21, 2026)

### Changed
- Condensed `/hegelion` slash command and Codex skill to minimal routing tables
- Removed verbose manual workflows in favor of MCP-first approach

## 0.4.3 – MCP Refactor + Codex Skill (January 12, 2026)

### Added
- **Codex skill**: Added `skills/hegelion/SKILL.md` for the `/hegelion` workflow

### Changed
- Refactored MCP server into tooling, handlers, validation, and response helpers

## 0.4.2 – Unified /hegelion Command (January 2026)

### Added
- **`/hegelion` command**: Single entry point for both dialectical and autocoding workflows
- **Host shortcuts**: `hegelion-setup-mcp --host claude-desktop|cursor|vscode|windsurf`

### Changed
- Consolidated separate autocoding command and skill into unified `/hegelion`
- Code formatted with black

## 0.4.1 – Schema Versioning (December 2025)

### Added
- **Schema versioning**: All structured outputs include `schema_version`
- **Phase clarity**: `player_prompt` and `coach_prompt` include `current_phase` and `next_phase`
- **Error handling**: Invalid transitions return structured errors with `expected`, `received`, `hint`

## 0.4.0 – Autocoding System (December 2025)

### Added
- **Player-Coach loop**: Dialectical autocoding based on Block AI's g3 agent research
- **MCP tools**: `autocoding_init`, `player_prompt`, `coach_prompt`, `autocoding_advance`
- **Session persistence**: `autocoding_save` / `autocoding_load`
- **Single-shot mode**: `autocoding_single_shot` for simpler tasks
- **Brand entrypoint**: `hegelion` tool with `mode` parameter

## 0.3.2 – MCP Server Simplification

### Removed
- **MCP `run_dialectic` tool:** Removed the server-side execution tool that required LLM API configuration. Users on Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code, etc. should use `dialectical_single_shot` or `dialectical_workflow` instead—these generate prompts that your editor's LLM executes directly, with no API keys needed.

### Changed
- **Updated `mcp_instructions.md`:** Documentation now guides agents to use prompt-generation tools (`dialectical_single_shot`, `dialectical_workflow`) rather than server-side execution.

### Why This Change
The `run_dialectic` MCP tool required server-side API keys (e.g., `HEGELION_PROVIDER`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), which was confusing for MCP users who expected a zero-config experience. The prompt-generation tools provide the same dialectical reasoning without any server-side LLM configuration.

## 0.3.1 – Response Styles & Gemini CLI Extension Support

### Added
- **New Response Styles:** Added two new response formats for dialectical workflows:
  - `conversational`: Natural dialogue format with smooth transitions like "but on the other hand..." and "so perhaps the best way forward is..."
  - `bullet_points`: Concise bullet-point format with clearly marked Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis sections for quick scanning
  - Full compatibility with existing `json`, `sections`, and `synthesis_only` styles
- **New: Gemini CLI Extension:** Added official support for the Gemini CLI. You can now install Hegelion directly as an extension to use dialectical tools within your Gemini CLI workflows.
- **New: `GEMINI.md` Context:** Included a persistent context file to guide the Gemini model on how to use Hegelion's dialectical tools effectively.

## 0.3.0 – Model-Agnostic Support & Feature Expansion

- **New: Model-Agnostic MCP Server:** Introduced `hegelion-prompt-server` which allows using Hegelion with *any* model configured in your editor/IDE (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Desktop) without needing API keys.
- **New: Persona-Based Critiques:** Configure specific personas for the antithesis phase (e.g., "Council of Critics," "Security Engineer," "Ruthless Editor") via the Python API.
- **New: Iterative Refinement:** Support for looping the dialectical process (Synthesis Round 1 → Thesis Round 2) for deeper analysis.
- **New: Search Grounding:** Instruct models to verify claims with search tools during the antithesis phase.
- **Changed:** The `hegelion` CLI is now primarily a demo/summary tool. Advanced workflows (personas, iterations) are available via the Python API and MCP servers.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive rewrite of README and documentation to emphasize the dual-path usage (Prompt-Based vs. API-Based).

## 0.2.3 – MCP/assistant integration polish
