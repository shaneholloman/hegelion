## Model-Agnostic Hegelion: Works with Any LLM

This version of Hegelion works with **whatever LLM is currently calling the MCP server** instead of making its own API calls. Perfect for:

- **Cursor**
- **Claude Desktop**
- **VS Code**
- **Antigravity** or other MCP-compatible environments

## 🎯 **The Problem This Solves**

Instead of configuring API keys and making external calls, users can:

1. Use Hegelion with their existing LLM setup
2. Experience dialectical reasoning with any model
3. No additional configuration or costs
4. Works instantly in any MCP environment

## 🛠️ **How It Works**

The `hegelion-prompt-server` returns **structured prompts** instead of making API calls:

### Single-Shot Dialectic (Powerful Models)
```python
# For models that can handle complex reasoning
prompt = await dialectical_single_shot(
    query="Can AI be genuinely creative?",
    use_search=True,
    use_council=True
)
# Returns one comprehensive prompt that guides the LLM through:
# THESIS → ANTITHESIS → SYNTHESIS
```

### Step-by-Step Workflow (Any Model)
```python
# For systematic execution
workflow = await dialectical_workflow(
    query="Should we implement universal basic income?", 
    use_council=True,
    use_judge=True,
    format="workflow"
)
# Returns structured steps that can be executed sequentially
```

### Manual Step Control
```python
# For maximum control
step1 = await thesis_prompt(query="Your question")
step2 = await antithesis_prompt(query="Your question", thesis="<result from step1>")  
step3 = await synthesis_prompt(query="Your question", thesis="<step1>", antithesis="<step2>")
```

## 📋 **Available Tools**

### `dialectical_workflow`
Returns a structured workflow for step-by-step execution:
- **Input**: query, options (search, council, judge)
- **Output**: JSON workflow with step-by-step prompts
- **Best for**: Systematic execution, complex queries

### `dialectical_single_shot`  
Returns one comprehensive prompt for powerful models:
- **Input**: query, options (search, council)
- **Output**: Single prompt with complete instructions
- **Best for**: Large context models capable of multi-step reasoning

### `thesis_prompt` / `antithesis_prompt` / `synthesis_prompt`
Individual step prompts for manual control:
- **Best for**: Custom workflows, experimentation

## 🎭 **Feature Support**

All Phase 2 features work in prompt-driven mode:

- **🔍 Search Grounding**: Prompts include instructions to use available search tools
- **👥 Council Critiques**: Generates Logician + Empiricist + Ethicist perspectives
- **⚖️ Quality Evaluation**: Includes structured evaluation prompts
- **📊 Structured Output**: Guides LLM to return properly formatted results

## 🔧 **Setup**

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

Run:
```bash
hegelion-setup-mcp
```
Copy the output to your `claude_desktop_config.json` or Cursor MCP settings.

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to configure it manually:

#### Claude Desktop
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hegelion-prompt": {
      "command": "hegelion-prompt-server",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor/VS Code
1. Install Hegelion MCP extension (or configure via command)
2. Configure to use `hegelion-prompt-server`
3. Works with any model you have configured

## 💡 **Usage Examples**

### Example Output: "Untapped Resource for Technological Advancement"

> **Query:** "What is a potential untapped resource for technological advancement?"

<details open>
<summary><b>🔍 Phase 1: The Thesis</b></summary>

**Proposal:** *Industrial Waste Heat for Compute*  
Use waste heat from factories to power "thermo-computational" networks, turning entropy into zero-cost energy.
</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>⚔️ Phase 2: The Antithesis (Council of Critics)</b></summary>

- **The Logician**: *Thermodynamic Limit Conflict.* Carnot efficiency limits make converting low-grade heat to electricity fundamentally unviable.
- **The Empiricist**: *Spatial Mismatch.* Factories are hot/dirty environments; data centers require cool/clean ones. The engineering overhead outweighs the gain.
- **The Ethicist**: *Perverse Incentives.* Monetizing waste encourages industries to *remain* inefficient to sell their "fuel."
</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>✨ Phase 3: The Synthesis</b></summary>

**Resolution:** *Latent Heat Storage as a Service*  
The breakthrough isn't **converting** heat (inefficient), but leveraging the **demand** for heat. 

Instead of making electricity from heat, we place compute nodes inside water heaters and district heating systems. The "waste" heat from the computer becomes the useful product (hot water), achieving 100% system efficiency and resolving the "Perverse Incentive" by replacing fossil fuel heating with compute-generated heat.

*   **Research Proposal**: Micro-Fluidic Compute Heaters
*   **Prediction**: Decentralized compute heaters can reduce household energy consumption by 15%.

### Quick Dialectical Analysis
1. Call `dialectical_single_shot` tool
2. Paste the returned prompt into your LLM
3. Get complete thesis → antithesis → synthesis

### Structured Workflow
1. Call `dialectical_workflow` tool
2. Execute each step from the JSON workflow
3. Use outputs from previous steps as inputs to next steps

### Council-Enhanced Analysis
1. Use `use_council=true` in any tool
2. Get multi-perspective critiques (Logic, Empirical, Ethical)
3. Comprehensive analysis from multiple expert viewpoints

## 🚀 **Benefits**

- **Zero Configuration**: No API keys or backend setup needed
- **Model Flexibility**: Works with any modern LLM capable of instruction following
- **Cost Efficiency**: Uses your existing LLM setup, no additional charges  
- **Instant Access**: Experience dialectical reasoning immediately
- **Full Feature Set**: All Phase 2 capabilities (search, council, judge) available

This approach makes Hegelion truly accessible to any user with any LLM setup!
