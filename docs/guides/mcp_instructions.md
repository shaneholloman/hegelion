# Hegelion MCP Instructions for Agents

If you are an AI agent (like Claude, ChatGPT/Codex, Gemini, or a Cursor agent) connected to the Hegelion MCP server, follow these instructions to use the tools effectively.

## Core Capability

Hegelion is a **Dialectical Reasoning Engine**. It does not just "answer" questions; it forces a structured conflict between ideas to produce a higher-order truth.

## When to Use Hegelion

Use Hegelion tools when the user asks:
- High-stakes philosophical or strategic questions.
- Questions involving "truth", "bias", or "nuance".
- "Analyze this dialectically."
- "What are the contradictions in X?"
- Any query where a simple summary is insufficient and deep reasoning is required.

## Available Tools

| Tool | Best For |
|------|----------|
| `dialectical_single_shot` | Quick analysis - returns one prompt you execute |
| `dialectical_workflow` | Step-by-step - returns thesis/antithesis/synthesis prompts |
| `thesis_prompt` | Manual control - get just the thesis prompt |
| `antithesis_prompt` | Manual control - critique a thesis |
| `synthesis_prompt` | Manual control - synthesize thesis + antithesis |

## Recommended: `dialectical_single_shot`

For most cases, use `dialectical_single_shot`. It returns a single comprehensive prompt that guides you through the entire dialectical process.

**Call the tool:**
```json
{
  "query": "Is open source software sustainable?",
  "response_style": "sections"
}
```

**Response styles:**
- `"sections"` - Full Thesis/Antithesis/Synthesis sections (default)
- `"synthesis_only"` - Just the final resolution
- `"json"` - Structured JSON with all fields (recommended for programmatic agents like Codex/ChatGPT)

**Then execute the returned prompt.** The prompt contains instructions for you to perform the dialectical reasoning.

## Alternative: `dialectical_workflow`

For more control, use `dialectical_workflow`. It returns a sequence of prompts you execute in order:

```json
{
  "query": "Is open source software sustainable?",
  "format": "workflow",
  "response_style": "json"
}
```

This returns:
1. A thesis prompt - execute it and save the output
2. An antithesis prompt - requires the thesis output
3. A synthesis prompt - requires both thesis and antithesis

## Presenting Results

After executing the dialectical reasoning, present it to the user:

> **Synthesis:** [The resolution that transcends both positions]
>
> **The Core Tension:** The initial view (Thesis) argued X, but the critique (Antithesis) identified that Y. The synthesis resolves this by Z.

If relevant, include:
- **Key Contradictions** found during the antithesis phase
- **Research Proposals** for further investigation

## Advanced Options

Both tools support optional enhancements:

- `use_search: true` - Adds instructions to use search tools for real-world grounding
- `use_council: true` - Enables multi-perspective critique (Logician, Empiricist, Ethicist)
- `use_judge: true` - Adds a quality evaluation step (workflow only)

## Autocoding Tools (Implementation Loops)

Use these when you want a player/coach loop for coding tasks:
- `hegelion` as a branded entrypoint (`mode`: `init`, `workflow`, `single_shot`)
- `autocoding_init` → `player_prompt` → `coach_prompt` → `autocoding_advance`
- `autocoding_workflow` for a structured step-by-step recipe
- `autocoding_single_shot` for a single prompt that alternates roles internally
