## Legacy Result

This example predates the current synthesis-focused architecture and represents an earlier experimental version of the system.

For current examples that better demonstrate Hegelion's dialectical synthesis approach, see:
- `examples/consciousness_example.md` - Philosophical inquiry with full synthesis
- `examples/gravity_example.md` - Scientific frontier questions
- `examples/ai_creativity_example.md` - Analysis of co-creative systems

These newer examples showcase Hegelion's unique ability to:
1. Generate genuine thesis-antithesis-synthesis structures
2. Identify explicit contradictions
3. Propose testable research directions
4. Maintain clean metadata and provenance tracking
